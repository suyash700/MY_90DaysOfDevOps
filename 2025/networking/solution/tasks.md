🚀 Week 1: Networking Challenge | #90DaysOfDevOps
Welcome to Week 1 of my #90DaysOfDevOps – 2025 Edition journey! This week was all about building a rock-solid foundation in Networking, one of the core pillars in the DevOps world. Here's a breakdown of everything I covered:

📚 1. OSI & TCP/IP Models – The Backbone of Communication
✅ Learned about the 7 layers of OSI and 4 layers of TCP/IP models
✅ Mapped real-world protocols to each layer

Example Mapping:

OSI Layer	Real-world Example
Application	   HTTP, FTP, SSH
Presentation	SSL/TLS Encryption
Session	API   Sessions, Authentication
Transport	  TCP/UDP
Network	IP   addressing, Routers
Data Link	 MAC Addresses, Switches
Physical	 Ethernet Cables, Wi-Fi

🌐 2. Protocols and Ports – Know Your Essentials
✅ Studied commonly used DevOps protocols and their port numbers

Key Protocols & Ports Table:

Protocol	Port	Usage in DevOps
HTTP	    80	    Web servers, APIs
HTTPS	    443	    Secure web communication
SSH	        22      Remote access to servers
FTP	        21	    File transfer
DNS	        53	    Domain name resolution



☁️ 3. AWS EC2 & Security Groups – First Cloud Steps
✅ Launched a Free Tier EC2 instance on AWS
✅ Understood Security Groups and how to allow inbound/outbound rules
✅ Configured access via SSH (Port 22) and set up basic firewall rules



🛠️ 4. Networking Commands – Terminal Skills
Practiced essential Linux networking commands and their use cases:

Command	Purpose
ping	Check connectivity to a host
traceroute	View packet journey across network nodes
netstat	Show open ports and connections
curl	Make HTTP requests from CLI
dig/nslookup	DNS lookup and name resolution



🔥 Key Takeaways
Networking isn't just for SysAdmins—it's a DevOps essential

Knowing how data flows from your local dev to a cloud server makes debugging and optimization much easier

Practical hands-on + conceptual clarity = long-term retention
